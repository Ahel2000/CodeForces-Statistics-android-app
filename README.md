# CodeForces-Statistics
This is an android application that gives all statistical data in visual form of a Codeforces User, including submissions, verdict counts, rating graph and much more. Moreover, it also gives a real-time list of all upcoming contests on CF, everything at the drop of a hat !

Resources used: Official APIs of Codeforces, MPAndroidChart (v3.1.0) and made with latest Android Studio.



Update: v1.0.5 (minor bug regarding a Stats Display feature has been fixed !)
